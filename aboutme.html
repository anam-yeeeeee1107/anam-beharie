            <p>Heyyy!! I'm Anam Beharie, aged 15 and born on July 1st, 2009. I am originally from Durban, South Africa but have Indian ancestors. This is my story... When I was just at the mere age of 4, I immigrated to New Zealand and stayed with my aunt and her family for a couple of years. Although most my of family was back in South Africa, I'm still very close with them. For 6 months I went to the kindy down the road from my aunt's and when I turned 5, I went to Point View School and Somerville Intermediate before starting at BDSC, which is where I'm at now. I guess it wasn't so bad moving to NZ, after all I had some of my cousins, aunties, uncles and closest friends here who I am very grateful for,  guiding and supporting me through my highs and lows in life. Ever since I was a little girl there were five things I wanted in my life forever: happiness; love; my family and my best friends; a good education and career; and lastly, to travel the world!<br>😁❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👯🏫🛫🌍</p>

            <p>Ever since I was young, I've been drawn to thrilling adventures. I went crazy on the monkey bars so heights was never an issue for me. There are so many things I'd want to do when I'm older. I'd go jet-skiing in Florida, paragliding in Dubai, scuba-diving and exploring the underwater wonders of the Maldives, skydive in Australia, bungee jump in Taupo, experience exhilarating rollercoasters around the world like at Six Flags, go on a huge trip to countries in Europe, skii in Japan's beautiful Mt Fuji, and eat my way through the Thailand markets. Some other things I love doing is hiking, biking, swimming, yoga, art, solving my rubiks cube, listening to music, learning violin and 中文 and playing boardgames with my family. I also LOVE to watch movies and tv shows. My favourite movies are 2012, titanic, the smurfs, the karate kid, ratatoullie, 101 dalmations and kal ho naa ho. And my favourite tv shows are friends, young sheldon, <br> cobra kai, suits and full house. <br> 🪂🌊🚴‍♀️🤸‍♀️🎶⚽🍿

        <p>At BDSC I am a Junior Lead, a part of the Service Committee, Enviroschools, International Student Buddy Team and Orienteering Club. Right now, Maths is my strongest subject so far as I have been getting excellences or how the Americans would put it, straight A's. I also enjoy all of my tech subjects which are DVC, DIT and TEM (hard-materials) and I am proud of myself for doing well in them as each subject has their own unique challenges.</p>
